                If you hate Starbucks, then you're in the right place. Here at Starbucks Sucks, we don't care about the customers. We only care about crushing our main competitor, Starbucks. So if you care about coffee at all, you can go fuck yourself.

        What Makes Us Great

                <img src="./img/rude.jpg" alt="Rude Staff" width="200" height="150">
                Each of our branch has its own body of professional trolls whose entire job is to be rude to you. Upon entering the door, our staff will bombared you with verbal abuse and personal insults that will make you question every decision you ever made. They will follow you around and get in the way of whatever it is you are doing.

            <div class="img-sub-2">
                <img src="./img/you-make-your-own-coffee.jpg" alt="Our best customer making his own coffee" width="200" height="150">
                We wanted our staff to focus solely on the job of being rude to you. That's why there's no one behind the counter, and therefore you have to make the coffee yourself. See that guy in the picture? That's our best customer. He hates Starbucks so much that he will endure any abuse and inconvenience. What a wimp.

                What's a cafe without a soft, soothing music? From dawn 'till evening, we will be blasting Baby Shark on repeat with our state-of-the-art speaker system, built to make your last song syndrome last for two weeks. We guarantee youd'be hearing Baby Shark even in your sleep.

                <img src="./img/expensive.jpg" alt="Coffee costs a lot" width="200" height="150">
                Although our coffee tastes like rat piss, each cup costs around $13,000. Why is it so expensive, you might ask? We need it to pay the mob to fuck over whoever tries to sue us. And if that doesn't teach them a lesson, our CEO will personally come over your house while you're asleep and light your bedroom on fire.
