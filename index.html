                <img src="./img/rude.jpg" alt="Rude Staff" width="240" height="180">
                <p class="img-p">Each of our branch has its own body of professional trolls whose entire job is to be rude to you. Upon entering the door, you will be bombarded with verbal abuse and personal insults that will make you question every decision you ever made. And throughout your stay, our staff will follow you around and get in the way of whatever it is you are doing.</p>

                <p>We wanted our staff to focus solely on the job of being rude to you, which is why no one is behind the counter. We reserve to you the gift of making your own coffee. See that guy in the picture? That's our best customer. He hates Starbucks so much that he will endure any abuse and inconvenience. What a wimp.</p>

                <p class="img-p">What's a cafe without a soft, soothing music? From dawn 'till evening, we will be blasting Baby Shark on repeat with our state-of-the-art speaker system, designed to make the last song syndrome you'll get persist for two weeks. We believe it is our duty to make sure you can hear Baby Shark even in your sleep.</p>

                <p>Although our coffee tastes like rat piss, each cup costs around $13,000. Why is it so expensive, you ask? We need it to pay the mob to fuck over whoever is dumb enough to sue us. And if that doesn't teach them a lesson, our CEO will personally visit them while they're asleep and light their house on fire.</p>
